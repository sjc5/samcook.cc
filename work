### TalkJot App

- I created <a href="https://talkjot.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TalkJot</a>, a privacy-friendly React Native app that makes it easy to email yourself notes using your voice.
- It's spartan (by design), but surprisingly useful when you're out and about.</li>
- It's live on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkjot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talkjot-voice-to-email-notes/id1499580999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apple App Store</a> if you want to check it out.

### Monty Hall Game

- I built a <a href="https://montyhall.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Monty Hall Problem Simulator</a> (loosely based on the old _Let's Make a Deal_ game show) using 100% vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- It's a fun way to learn about the classic, counter-intuitive statistics puzzle that has haunted mathematicians for decades.
- Although the rules of play are simple, the game logic, conditional rendering and statistics tracking were rather complicated to implement. If you spot any bugs, please <a href="{{ "/contact/" | url }}">let me know</a>!

### This Site

- I built this site using 11ty and spent a lot of time customizing the look and feel to maximize (a)&nbsp;responsiveness, (b)&nbsp;readability, (c)&nbsp;speed and (d)&nbsp;navigability. In other words, I wanted to make this site as non-annoying as possible.
- Overall, it's a pretty good representation of my personal design preferences (for a site like this, that is).
- One thing you will notice – especially when clicking around in the <a href="{{ "/blog/" | url }}">blog</a> – is the context-dependence of the navigation menus (in both the header and footer). This took a decent amount of conditional logic in my 11ty layouts to accomplish, and I'm really happy with the result.
- If you have any usability or accessibility feedback, please <a href="{{ "/contact/" | url }}">let me know</a>.
