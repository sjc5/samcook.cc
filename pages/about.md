- I'm a freelance React developer and UI designer focused on making clean, fast, resilient and privacy-friendly websites and apps.
- I am very excited about web3 and other decentralized, freedom-enhancing technologies.
- I have a J.D. degree (full ride, second in class).
- I was a full-time corporate lawyer for about five years before shifting my focus to building. A few corporate clients still occupy a slice of my time, but these days I prefer to write code than contracts. I am <a href="/blog/rules/#rule-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">not your lawyer</a>.
- My interests include philosophy, logic, writing, psychology, privacy, the art of decision-making, startups and investing.
- My hobbies include playing electric guitar, recording music and taking pictures.
