- I'm a React developer and UI designer focused on making clean, fast, resilient and privacy-friendly websites and apps.
- I am very excited about web3 and other decentralized, freedom-enhancing technologies.
- I have a J.D. degree (full ride, top 2% class rank).
- I practiced as a full-time corporate lawyer for about five years before shifting my focus to building. I much prefer writing code over contracts (unless they're smart contracts ðŸ˜Š). I am <a href="/blog/rules/#rule-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">not your lawyer</a>!
- My interests include philosophy, logic, writing, psychology, privacy, the art of decision-making, startups and investing.
- My hobbies include playing electric guitar, recording music and taking pictures.
